#Guesser_Game
This a game where we require three objects those are a umpire, a player & a guesser .Where a guesser guesses a number & tells to the umpire & then umpire notes down that particular number & then asks players to predict the number which guesser has said to the umpier & then umpier notes down the prediction of the players & then compares those numbers from the guessers number & the player who predicts the same number what guesser has said to the umpier .
Then that player will be the winner of the guesser game.!
